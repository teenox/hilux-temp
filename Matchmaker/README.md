### Where is matchmaker?
The matchmaker has been removed. It was not a good refernce for how to handle Pixel Streaming at scale and was adding to maintenance work, so we made the decision to remove it and discontinue its support.

### What if I still need Matchmaker?
You can still obtain it from older revisions of this repo. It is removed for UE5.5, but any previous version of the Infrastructure repo will still have it, latest one being [UE 5.4 matchmaker](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/tree/UE5.4/Matchmaker).
